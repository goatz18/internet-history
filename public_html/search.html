            <h2>February 7, 1958</h2>
            <h4>President Eisenhower Founds ARPA</h4>
            <p>
                The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), known as DARPA today, was founded after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 in 1957. One of their projects was ARPANET, and it aimed at creating a wide area packet switched network with distributed control, the foundation that the modern internet sits upon.
            </p>
            <h2>J.C. Licklider</h2>
            <h4>The Math Behind The Idea of Modern Packet Switching</h4>
            <p>
                A psychologist and computer scientist by trade, it's Licklider who created the framework for the mathematics behind the idea of sending a self certifiable message over a packet switched network. Other members of ARPA and the scientific community, using his initial mathematics, helped get ARPANET off the ground.
            </p>
            <h2>Leonard Kleinrock</h2>
            <h4>Que-ing Theory</h4>
            <p>
                Kleinrock's doctoral thesis at MIT was on the mathematics of Que-ing theory, which was crucial to packet switching and formed a basis for how the decentralized "nodes" will communicate over the early ARPANET.
            </p>
            <h2>Paul Baran</h2>
            <h4>"Hot Potato" Routing"</h4>
            <p>
                Baran pioneered the idea of the fish net network, or "Hot Potato" routing, which is to send chopped up pieces of a message with each piece being it's own packet. Each packet had a "to" and "from" attached to itself, in case any piece "got lost," it could find it's way, or another packet would be sent. When all the packets would finally arrive, they would be assembled, and the message will be delivered.
            </p>

            <p>
                They took Licklider's, and all the other's mathematics, and combined them into the necessary electrical engineering behind the early ARPANET. They created the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, which is one of the backbones of the modern Internet.
            </p>
            <h4>Bob Taylor</h4>
            <p>
                Played an instrumental role in connecting large mainframe computers to multiple individual client computers. Before that there was just one client for each mainframe computer. He also was key to eventually getting all mainframe computers connected to each other directly.
            </p>
            <h4>Larry Roberts</h4>
            <p>
                Recruited to assist Bob Taylor to network the mainframe computers together. Different locations used different mainframes and they were not built to communicate to other mainframes. They utilized an innovative approach where each mainframe would have to be uniquely coded to an Interface Messaging Processor (IMP), that then communicated to other IMPs that were connected and coded to other mainframes.

                BBN Team Lead Frank Heart and team won the contract to build the ARPANET mainframe IMPs on July 1, 1969. The first IMP was delivered to UCLA and graduate student Stephen Crocker wrote the code for UCLA's computer to communicate with. Later, Bob Metcalf codes MIT's mainframe to communicate with it's IMP.
